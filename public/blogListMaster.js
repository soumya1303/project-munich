In Ceylon, they would fill their dinghy with fresh supplies before setting sail to the northern tip of Sumatra. (Called Swarnadwipa or Island of Gold). The youngsters and the more daring lot would head further south hugging the western coast to Java (Called Yavadwipa or the Island of Grain) and Bali. \nAlong with nutmeg and cinnamon, the Indian merchants would also carry the stories of Lord Rama, the prince of mythical state of Ayodhya. Stories on how he had sent Sugriva, the monkey God and his chief of army staff, to Yavadwipa to find his missing wife Seeta. The merchants carried with them the ancient knowledge, wisdom, scriptures, science, medicines and more than anything else their religion, Hindiusm – The Sanatan Dharma. While some continued the journey, few younger ones found love in these alien lands and settled down happily with Bali Aga or Bali Mula (aborigine Balinese woman).

It is called as Agama Hindu Dharma. It was originated from Java and is a blend of Shivaism and Buddhism. The religious and cultural impact of Hinduism on the Balinese island and her people are fascinating and are reflected in their lives, cultures and art forms. Take the example of the Mandala System, enforced by the kings in the 11th century. Seen in the structures of almost all Balinese temples, it divides the whole construction into 3 parts – (a) Jaba or the outer yard (b) Jaba Tengah or the middle yard and (c) Jeroan or the inner yard. The concept of Tri Mandala is inspired by the circle of life and the journey of the immortal soul as depicted in Hindu Puranas (a) Swarga Loka or The Kingdom of Gods (b) Martya Loka or The Human Kingdom and (c) The Patal Loka or The Home of The Fallen Gods and Demons. \nIt may also be worthwhile to point out that each of the Balinese temple is associated with either of the three major Hindu Gods. Known as The Holy Trinity, Pura Puseh (Wisnu as the protector), Pura Desa (Brahma as creator) and Pura Dalem (Shiva as the destroyer) have captured and dominated the Balinese imagination from time immemorial. The reader may jump to our Travel Blog section to get to know some of the magnificent monuments dedicated to The Holy Trinity. These structures have stood firm against the test of time and have mesmerised tourists even since."

Between 6th-8th centuries the influence of classical Hindu and Buddhist architectural styles were in abundance in construction of temples, houses, village courtyards and public places. The principle of Kaja Kelod, is one of the main guidelines of the Balinese architecture. Kaja meaning Facing the Volcanoes and Kelod meaning Facing the Sea. This concept is often used in planning the placement of houses or temples in the villages. Sacred buildings, such as temples are placed in the Kaja section. Normal buildings, such as residential houses are usually placed in the Kelod section. \nFun Fact: For houses to get legalised in Bali, it cannot exceed the height of a coconut tree (roughly 15 meters)"

As the aircraft hovered over the Vegas skyline, I could spot humongous building with bright colourful lights, most of which are hotels and casinos and signs big enough that you can read from far above in the sky.  I spotted the flash light from the top of a giant pyramid (Luxor it was), the tall tower of the Stratosphere, the Eiffel tower adorning the hotel Paris, the emerald green of the MGM and while I was busy spotting as many famous hotels I could, bang we were on the runway! I was far too excited to realise that I am finally going to step into this dreamworld."

He was regarded as Catalan modernist for his own unique personality and style. He used natural colours and patterns for his designs and material like stained glass, ceramics, wrought iron.

Some melodious tunes are played on the xylophone and flutes with occasional beats from Kendang (hand played drum) and gongs before a couple of beautifully dressed girls enter the stage. \nHeavily ornate with gold crowns, magnificent jewellery and highly embroidered dresses, they use swift hand and leg movements and vivid impressions to enact the dance drama. The ambience is gripping and you miss to notice that few mosquitoes have nested on your toes! \nI scratched a little and then immersed back deep into the drama. ‘Legong Kraton’ translates to ‘dance of the royal palace’ as in the past this was only performed within closed palace walls for the Royal family. Now though, it is performed at many places, incl. here in the Ubud Royal Palace. \nTIPS: Reach at least 30-40mins early to grab the best seats. The performance is held in the open palace grounds so, do carry some good bug spray to keep mosquitoes away."

Indonesia’s fascination towards Ramayana is not new — they have taken inspiration from both Sage Valmiki’s Ramayana and Tamil poet Kamban’s Ramayana and so it remains in the imagination and cultural milieu of the country. Kecak originated rom an old Balinese ritual called the Sanghyan. No musical instruments are used in this performance but instead a group of around 50, bare chested men, wearing black and white chequered sarong (wrap skirt) sits around a circle and repetitively chant 'Chak...Chak...Chak...' to create the background score for the dance drama. They do this in accordance to the emotion and milieu of the story. The story revolves around Lord Rama (the prince), his wife Sita and his brother Lakshman (also a young prince), who are in exile in the jungle and Ravana (the demon), who has casted an evil eye on Sita and plans to kidnap her. Garuda, who spots this tries to stop him while he is flying away with Sita in Pushpak Vimana (the flying chariot). The drama, the expressions, the performance of both Garuda and Ravana is outstanding and the scenes will leave you spell bound. You can’t help but notice getting emotionally involved deep into the tale. "

The amphitheatre too has started to get darker but, just then the monkey god Hanuman enters the stage and lights Ravana’s palace on fire, in order to help Ram rescue Sita. The ‘Chak...Chak...Chak’ chorus turns further dramatic, the colours, the fire and the final war scene of Ram with aid from Sugriva and Hanuman, good against evil is sensational and finally it all comes to an end when Ravana is defeated."

Pure tropical bliss with temperatures averaging 22 degs. in the central and hilly areas and reaching up to 27 deg. in the coastal areas. Sunrise over the volcanic mountains in the north to lush terraced paddy fields in the central plain continues to the wild and glorious coastline in the south, Bali offers extraordinary panoramic views at every step. It is not possible to see everything this mesmerising Island has to offer but anything you may manage to witness, is still going to leave an everlasting impression on you for a very long time. \nOff all my travels across multiple countries and continents, this is that one trip which is going to stay on my head and heart for a long time. Everytime some asks me about my favourite holiday, I can’t stop myself from saying ‘Bali, it is!’. \nEven though Indonesia is predominantly a Muslim country, Bali is a Hindu dominant island. It’s culture, food, art and craft all have Hindu influence and this is evident by a number of beautifully constructed Temples across the island. \nSo even though I didn’t go to Bali for any spiritual or religious reasons, I couldn’t stop visiting one temple after another after another. Here is a short column on what I did in the God’s own island."

Set in the backdrop of the dense forests, Monkey forest sanctuary is home to three temples and several grey tailed macaques. Adorned with stone sculptures the temple and the temple ground gave me the feeling of being on an Indiana Jones movie…an ancient feel, tranquil jungle, stone platforms and sculptures covered with fern and mosses, an ancient mysterious water body and branches hanging so low that it almost touches the ground. \nTIPS: Don’t miss out the 14th Century Pura Dalem Agung Padanglegal – The temple of death, dedicated to Hindu God Shiva and the dragon staircase, adorned with hanging Banyan tree roots."

After a quick breakfast of delicious banana pancakes (with sprinkle of grated coconut and palm sugar), we started for our tour to the west of Ubud, to visit the famous Taman Ayun Temple. About 19kms from Ubud central this temple is surrounded by several Meru towers, which are Pagoda like shrines and numerous water features. Away from the crowd and hustle bustle, the serene lush green temple ground is a very quiet and a peaceful place. I found it restful for my mind and body and equally refreshing for the soul. I could have sat here for hours uninterrupted, but my fascination for this wonderful island provoked me to get going to explore more. \nFUN FACT: This temple garden is featured in the TV programme ‘Around the world in 80 gardens’. While in the garden, look out for a Barong in one of the out buildings."

It had rained earlier that day and the clouds were almost touching the lake which was adding onto the heavenly setting of this place. The stunningly picturesque view was beyond imagination, and I possibly can’t describe the beauty in words. I didn’t want to leave, more so this time and spend the afternoon soaking these views but I had to. Bima promised that we would not be disappointed anywhere we go on this island and any corner we chose to visit, so I should better get my lazy bum up and going. \nBima told is a couple of folklores as we head back south enjoying the alluring views on the way.
