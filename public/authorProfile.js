Or the more recent Best Exotic Marigold Hotel where the Taj Lake Palace can be seen from the roof terrace of the hotel where the British holidaymakers would gather for a pint? If you do, then you must also remember Udaipur, the magnificently photogenic city built around a series of artificial lakes and known for its lavish royal residences, redolent of the Raj."

As we moved along from one mine to another in that unforgiving arid landscape, all my childhood memories are reminiscent with this desolate yet picturesque valley, nicely tucked behind the mighty Aravalli range. Growing up in the mines had two telling effects in my formative years. One, I became close to the nature in its most raw and truest form. Waking up to the chirping of Indian Rufous Treepie, finding a Common Rock Python nicely snuggled in the shower room or even waving off an Indian Spotted Leopard while finishing your evening stroll was a common affair. Two, travelling became a way of life. We would travel through the dense forest and the daunting landscapes back to the civilization every day. For schools and for grocery, for music lessons and for eating outs."

Criss-crossing the country on a 1500 mile long Indian Railways for days through the Great Indian Hinterlands was a revelation on my young mind. Tea vendors jostling to attract eyeballs at crowded Allahabad station, or the Hindu monks in saffron robes praying to the early morning sun at the bank of The Ganges in Varanasi, would keep alluring the little girl in me to come out and experience the other world that awaited with open arms beyond the rugged terrain of Rajasthan. My father, as every other caring father would have done, sensed early what gets me going. On my pass out year to the uni, he gifted me a Sony DSC-P1, a 1.5” 3 Mega Pixel camera with 3x zoom, an absolute luxury for a regular Indian household in the 90's. But, for me, it turned out to be a game-changer. Now, not only could I live those moments as they passed by, but I could even frame those to re-live on another day. From Gateway of India in the west to The Howrah Bridge in the east, from the Golconda fort in the south to the icy Rohtang Pass in the north, I captured them all. It was much later, while I had already settled down in the UK that I gifted myself my first professional camera – Nikon D7100."

The wilderness of Mojave Desert brings back memories of the arid land I had left behind in Rajasthan, the chirpy puffins of Rutland Island would remind me of the Long-Tailed Shrikes that would unfailingly offer a guest appearance at my windowpane and would make sure I am not late for the school."

To tell you the story of my wander-ful life, often seen through my lenses. In return, if I could re-ignite the passion in you to hit the road again, I shall consider myself successful. Our power point presentations, balance sheets and sales graphs will surely live to see another day but the polar bears up the North Sea or the cave-arts at Altamira may not be that fortunate. \n\nSo, what are you waiting for?"
