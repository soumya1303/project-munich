Located in the south-eastern part of the Europe, Montenegro for most of the 20th century was part of Yugoslavia and then part of the federated union of Serbia and Montenegro. A hidden gem delineated by craggy mountains, medieval villages, vast fresh water lakes sprawling across the borders of Albania and the spectacular Adraitic coastline, Montenegro is truly a feast for eyes."

On Sundays the frequency goes down and there’s only one bus every two hours.

So easy to get lost here but even getting lost and discovering the city bits by bits is fun to travellers like me. If you are staying overnight in Kotor or Budva, do try and find an old boutique hotel for the authentic local experience. Combining traditional style with modern facilities, these stone buildings will take you back in time to the 18th century and some even back to the 13th century. Hotel Monte Cristo, is a 13th century stone building now restored with stylish furnishing. Or, Palazzo Radomiri Heritage Boutique Hotel, which is beautifully transformed from an early 18th century Baroque palace. If, the UNESCO protected old town of Kotor is in your mind, don’t worry and head to the Boutique Hotel Hippocampus. You can actually live within the fort walls."

Don’t be surprised that this is not open to public, it  is a 5 star hotel resort owned by Aman Resorts. It is home to 50 exclusive cottages and suites and 8 grand suites at Villa Miloc⌄er, overlooking pink sandy beaches and turquoise blue Adriatic Sea. A sight to remember for rest of your life. One of the 5 National parks, lake Skadar is the biggest in Balkan Peninsula and boast of its diversity of flora and fauna. Surrounded by mountains and covered by wetland, it is home to migratory birds like Dalmation pelican, Herons and Seagulls and Carp, bleak and Eel like fishes. You can either boat around the lake from Virpazar or alternatively use the popular viewpoint, Pavlova Strana or the horseshoe bend at the northwest corner of the lake. If you are driving, it can be reached on M2.3, 5kms past Meterizi on the right where you see the sign for Rijeka Crnojevica. <br /><br /><em>Travel tip:Park at Virpazar where you will also find local eateries and restaurant (and a toilet) before you head to the lake. The boat tours also have stand here but do not go with the first one who approaches you. Take time to decide which tour would you like to take. Anything between 1-2 hours is enough. Train connection to the station in Virpazar is available from Podgorica and so is the bus connection. If you are taking the bus, don’t ask for Skadar as there is a similar please in Albania across the lake. Ask for Virpazar or the Skadar National Park and the driver may drop you few hundred meters from the park entrance, if you are lucky ofc.</em>"

They bring it home but the next day, it disappears from home and reappears at the cliff. They once again bring it home but the next day it disappears as before. Seeing this, the brothers realize that Virgin Mary wishes to stay there and vows to build a church there. For centuries, fisherman on return from their trips and captain on return from their successful voyages repeat the customs to throw rocks and even old seized ships to that same cliff, thereby building the island which you can see today. The custom from the folklore is still alive today and is celebrated as Fasinada on the 22nd of July.There are small boats offering you ride from the shore to the Lady of the rock for around €5. Entrance to the museum is €1. Inside the museum, you’ll be able to get a guided tour for about €1 donation. The museum hosts archaeological finds from the city of Perast as well as sacred relics from the prehistoric age. <br /><br /><em>Tip: Shorts and bare shoulders dresses are not allowed unless you have something to cover off your legs and shoulders.

Women would place small paper boats in the water and watch them float away. As the cool breeze blow from the north, the full moon would make the crashing waves glimmer.  Immortalized through rituals, this is how the families of the ancient mariners would have bid goodbye to their loved ones on their voyage to the Balinese archipelago 2000 years ago. Known as “Bali Yatra” (Voyage to Bali), a fair is held every year in the month of November here in Cuttack, the present-day capital of Odisha."

In Ceylon, they would fill their dinghy with fresh supplies before setting sail to the northern tip of Sumatra. (Called Swarnadwipa or Island of Gold). The youngsters and the more daring lot would head further south hugging the western coast to Java (Called Yavadwipa or the Island of Grain) and Bali. Along with nutmeg and cinnamon, the Indian merchants would also carry the stories of Lord Rama, the prince of mythical state of Ayodhya. Stories on how he had sent Sugriva, the monkey God and his chief of army staff, to Yavadwipa to find his missing wife Seeta. The merchants carried with them the ancient knowledge, wisdom, scriptures, science, medicines and more than anything else their religion, Hindiusm – The Sanatan Dharma. While some continued the journey, few younger ones found love in these alien lands and settled down happily with Bali Aga or Bali Mula (aborigine Balinese woman).  Like a bonfire turns into a bushfire in no time, Hinduism soon started taking roots at a most unusual places of all, thousands of miles away from where it originated."

It is called as Agama Hindu Dharma. It was originated from Java and is a blend of Shivaism and Buddhism. The religious and cultural impact of Hinduism on the Balinese island and her people are fascinating and are reflected in their lives, cultures and art forms. Take the example of the Mandala System, enforced by the kings in the 11th century. Seen in the structures of almost all Balinese temples, it divides the whole construction into 3 parts – (a) Jaba or the outer yard (b) Jaba Tengah or the middle yard and (c) Jeroan or the inner yard. The concept of Tri Mandala is inspired by the circle of life and the journey of the immortal soul as depicted in Hindu Puranas (a) Swarga Loka or The Kingdom of Gods (b) Martya Loka or The Human Kingdom and (c) The Patal Loka or The Home of The Fallen Gods and Demons. It may also be worthwhile to point out that each of the Balinese temple is associated with either of the three major Hindu Gods. Known as The Holy Trinity, Pura Puseh (Wisnu as the protector), Pura Desa (Brahma as creator) and Pura Dalem (Shiva as the destroyer) have captured and dominated the Balinese imagination from time immemorial. The reader may jump to our Travel Blog section to get to know some of the magnificent monuments dedicated to The Holy Trinity. These structures have stood firm against the test of time and have mesmerised tourists even since."

Between 6th-8th centuries the influence of classical Hindu and Buddhist architectural styles were in abundance in construction of temples, houses, village courtyards and public places. The principle of Kaja Kelod, is one of the main guidelines of the Balinese architecture. Kaja meaning Facing the Volcanoes and Kelod meaning Facing the Sea. This concept is often used in planning the placement of houses or temples in the villages. Sacred buildings, such as temples are placed in the Kaja section. Normal buildings, such as residential houses are usually placed in the Kelod section. <br /><br /><em>Fun Fact: For houses to get legalised in Bali, it cannot exceed the height of a coconut tree (roughly 15 meters)</em>"

Welcome to Las Vegas or simply Vegas as millions of her admirers love to call her. <br /><br />However, Las Vegas did not even remotely resemble to what it is today when 110 acres of land were auctioned off by the railroad company on 15 May in 1905. The completion of the San Pedro, Los Angeles & Salt Lake Railroad, linking Southern California with Salt Lake City, established Las Vegas as a railroad town. The availability of water made her an ideal re-fuelling point and a pit stop.  In a city occupied mostly by railroad workers and ranchers, the spirit of the Wild West started to blossom. And with it came insinuations for prostitution, gambling and drinking despite Nevada ‘s 1910 ban on gambling."

No event in the history of Las Vegas had more profound impact on the city – both financially as well as culturally. By 1930, Las Vegas had only about 5,200 residents. Nearly all of its small hotels, stores, and other businesses were concentrated on one main thoroughfare, Fremont Street. The town was infamous for its lax enforcement of liquor laws during Prohibition and its backstreet brothels. In 1931, when the work on the dam started, the population swelled to 25000 with majority of the newcomers looking for a job at the dam site.  However, the demographic of the work force dominated by males with no strings attached to the area created a perfect market for large-scale adult entertainment. A combination of local business owners and Mafia crime lords helped develop the casinos and showgirl theatres to entertain the migrant workers."

The act allowed Las Vegas to open and operate legal casinos, also increased revenues from dam workers who came into town after work or on payday. Construction began on Boulder City in March 1931 by Six Companies Inc., the firm the federal government had awarded the contract to build the Dam.

The Hoover Dam Project quickly became a national tourist attraction as well. Thousands of these visitors would spend money in Las Vegas hotels, casinos, and other businesses. In 1932 alone, 100,000 people visited the dam construction site, and 200,000 visited Las Vegas. By 1934, 265,000 people went to the dam site and 300,000 went to Las Vegas.

An unfinished Roman Catholic basilica, standing tall in the centre of the city. For its importance in history and to preserve the famous Catalan art, Gaudi’s work on this building is part of UNESCO World Heritage Site."

But his architecture was replaced soon in 1883 by Antoni Gaudi, who was working on other projects at that time. Thereafter, until his death in 1926, Gaudi worked exclusively on Sagrada Familia but could only see the Bell Tower completed. Since then five generations have seen it being constructed and the construction is finally expected to be completed in 2026…I can’t wait to be back to admire the beauty in its entirety."

Some melodious tunes are played on the xylophone and flutes with occasional beats from Kendang (hand played drum) and gongs before a couple of beautifully dressed girls enter the stage. Heavily ornate with gold crowns, magnificent jewellery and highly embroidered dresses, they use swift hand and leg movements and vivid impressions to enact the dance drama. The ambience is gripping and you miss to notice that few mosquitoes have nested on your toes! I scratched a little and then immersed back deep into the drama. ‘Legong Kraton’ translates to ‘dance of the royal palace’ as in the past this was only performed within closed palace walls for the Royal family. Now though, it is performed at many places, incl. here in the Ubud Royal Palace. <br /><br /><strong>Travel Tips:</strong> Reach at least 30-40mins early to grab the best seats. The performance is held in the open palace grounds so, do carry some good bug spray to keep mosquitoes away."

Indonesia’s fascination towards Ramayana is not new — they have taken inspiration from both Sage Valmiki’s Ramayana and Tamil poet Kamban’s Ramayana and so it remains in the imagination and cultural milieu of the country. Kecak originated rom an old Balinese ritual called the Sanghyan. No musical instruments are used in this performance but instead a group of around 50, bare chested men, wearing black and white chequered sarong (wrap skirt) sits around a circle and repetitively chant 'Chak...Chak...Chak...' to create the background score for the dance drama. They do this in accordance to the emotion and milieu of the story. The story revolves around Lord Rama (the prince), his wife Sita and his brother Lakshman (also a young prince), who are in exile in the jungle and Ravana (the demon), who has casted an evil eye on Sita and plans to kidnap her. Garuda, who spots this tries to stop him while he is flying away with Sita in Pushpak Vimana (the flying chariot). The drama, the expressions, the performance of both Garuda and Ravana is outstanding and the scenes will leave you spell bound. You can’t help but notice getting emotionally involved deep into the tale. "

Everytime some asks me about my favourite holiday, I can’t stop myself from saying ‘Bali, it is!’. \nEven though Indonesia is predominantly a Muslim country, Bali is a Hindu dominant island. It’s culture, food, art and craft all have Hindu influence and this is evident by a number of beautifully constructed Temples across the island. \nSo even though I didn’t go to Bali for any spiritual or religious reasons, I couldn’t stop visiting one temple after another after another.

Away from the crowd and hustle bustle, the serene lush green temple ground is a very quiet and a peaceful place. I found it restful for my mind and body and equally refreshing for the soul. I could have sat here for hours uninterrupted, but my fascination for this wonderful island provoked me to get going to explore more. <br /><br /><em>Funfact: This temple garden is featured in the TV programme ‘Around the world in 80 gardens’. While in the garden, look out for a Barong in one of the out buildings</em>"

It had rained earlier that day and the clouds were almost touching the lake which was adding onto the heavenly setting of this place. The stunningly picturesque view was beyond imagination, and I possibly can’t describe the beauty in words. I didn’t want to leave, more so this time and spend the afternoon soaking these views but I had to. Bima promised that we would not be disappointed anywhere we go on this island and any corner we chose to visit, so I should better get my lazy bum up and going. \nBima told is a couple of folklores as we head back south enjoying the alluring views on the way. We took a detour through the tiered paddy fields and had our lunch overlooking the lush green fields, which has been brought to life just with that early morning rain."

Built on a rock, with the backdrop of Indian ocean amidst constantly crashing waves, it epitomises the mesmerising island of Bali. According to mythology a man named Dang Hyang Nirartha built the temple to worship Bhatara Segara – the sea god and created a poisonous snake to protect it. I heard the locals saying that many sea snakes still nest under the base of the temple. Scary! I didn’t dare to go to the rock but I would recommend caution if you do. <br /><br /><em>Trvale Tip: There are many shops near the entrance selling items of local art and handicraft and munchies like roasted monkey nuts and sweetcorn. I recommend you watch the sunset so get some munchies, grab a seat before it goes too crowded and watch the sun go down while you devour the sweetcorn</em>"

I sat there watching the droplets hit the pool with a splash and that frequent lightening drowning the entire villa with brightness. I was tired and drowsy but it was far too intriguing and fascinating to take me back to my bed. As we were up and about early, we decided to head to Ubud town to visit the Lotus temple. Situated between Ubud palace and Puri Lukisan museum, it is a beautiful premise with a large lotus pond lined with magnolia trees and the Pura Taman Kemuda Saraswati (Hindu god of art, culture and learning) temple standing tall in the centre. It also hosts a café on site which serves traditional Balinese breakfast/lunch/dinner. We took the seats overlooking the pond and enjoyed the famous Pisang Goreng, fried banana with grated coconut and palm sugar."

The famous Uluwatu temple and the Kecak dance performance. \nAlmost an hour and twenty mins from Ubud and very close to the International airport, Uluwatu temple lies in the southern part of the island. It is one of the very famous temples on the island and is made more famous due to its unique setting. Hanging on a cliff, approx.. 70mts above the crashing waves and facing the Indian ocean, Uluwatu temple is also home to numerous notorious monkeys. <br /><br /><em>Travel Tip: Remember the tip from the Monkey Forest Sanctuary, don’t keep items of jewellery, food, wallet, sunglasses or anything of that sort loose while you are on the premises. \nWait for the sunset, as you won’t see a backdrop as gorgeous and spell bounding as this, anywhere else in the world. Just around sunset, the cliff side open amphitheatre hosts the famous Kecak dance. It is a dance performance based on the Hindu epic ‘Ramayana’</em>"

Unique architecture, magnificent history, intriguing folklores, fascinating locations, all put together these temples cast a spell on you which you can’t escape. And so in my heart I know I will be back, back to explore what I haven’t seen and what I haven’t experienced. \nI can’t recommend Bali enough to all of you readers, but hopefully through my blogs I have tried enough to at least convince you to shortlist this for your next holiday. Cheers to the mesmerising island of Bali!"
